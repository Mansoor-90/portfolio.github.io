            <h3>"Design, development and fabrication of a solar air heater”</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed an efficient Solar air heater through Ansys design Modular. The absorber of the SAH consists of stainless steel tubes welded tangentially with each other. The design is simulated with and without phase change material (Paraffine wax).</li>
                <li>The Fabricated model is successfully tested, average raise in the ambient temperature at the outlet of double pass SAH is 15°C. At night time PCM radiated the heat during phase change from fluid to wax increased the temperature of the outlet air for 3 to 4 hr.</li>
